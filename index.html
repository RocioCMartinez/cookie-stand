    <h3>About the Owner</h3>
    <p>Pat Patterson has been a devoted hunter for over 15 years. Legend has it he was once stranded in the Alaskan Horseshoe Lake Trail, for three days Pat survived off salmon fish he managed to catch in the river. Once he was returned home his thirst for that salmon flavor could not be quenched. He started finding ways to include it in more practical recipies like his dogs favorite treat, cookies! Pat has managed to create a cookie that can be not only enjoyed by humans but dogs too. These days Pat spends his time baking with his family, experimenting with new flavors and ingredients.</p>
